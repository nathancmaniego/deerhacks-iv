# 🏡 Dormigo – Hackathon Project Summary

## 🚀 Theme: Discovery
**💡 Idea:** A one-stop platform that helps students discover rental listings and roommates by aggregating Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji, and university housing listings—all while using AI-powered roommate matching and trust scoring to reduce scams.

## The Problem: Student Housing is Broken
Due to fragmented and unreliable platforms, students struggle to find safe, affordable, and convenient housing. Current options are inefficient, resulting in wasted time, scams, and difficulty finding roommates.

### 1️⃣ Housing Listings are Scattered & Messy
- Students search across Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji, university portals, and random landlord websites.
- Listings are duplicated, outdated, or missing key details (e.g., utilities, furnished status).
- No smart search—students must manually filter through dozens of unrelated listings.

### 🔹 Why UniHousing Hub Works:
- ✅ **Aggregated Listings:** Combines data from Facebook, Kijiji, and university portals into one platform.
- ✅ **Smart Filtering & AI Search:** Quickly sort by rent, location, lease type, and amenities.
- ✅ **Interactive Map:** View listings by proximity to campus and transit options.

## 🧐 Meaning Behind the Name

**Dormigo** is a fusion of two words: **Dorm** + **Amigo**.

- **Dorm:** Reflects the core focus on student housing—dormitories and other student living spaces.
- **Amigo:** Spanish for "friend," conveying the platform's commitment to creating a friendly, trustworthy community where students can find reliable roommates and feel at home.

Together, Dormigo suggests a supportive, community-driven environment that not only helps you find a place to live but also connects you with like-minded roommates—making the often challenging search for safe and affordable student housing a more personal and reassuring experience.
