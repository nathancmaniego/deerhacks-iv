# 🏡 UniHousing Hub – Hackathon Project Summary

## 🚀 Theme: Discovery
**💡 Idea:** A one-stop platform that helps students discover rental listings and roommates by aggregating Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji, and university housing listings—all while using AI-powered roommate matching and trust scoring to reduce scams.

## The Problem: Student Housing is Broken
Students struggle to find safe, affordable, and convenient housing due to fragmented and unreliable platforms. Current options are inefficient, resulting in wasted time, scams, and difficulty finding roommates.

### 1️⃣ Housing Listings are Scattered & Messy
- Students search across Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji, university portals, and random landlord websites.
- Listings are duplicated, outdated, or missing key details (e.g., utilities, furnished status).
- No smart search—students must manually filter through dozens of unrelated listings.

### 🔹 Why UniHousing Hub Works:
- ✅ **Aggregated Listings:** Combines data from Facebook, Kijiji, and university portals into one platform.
- ✅ **Smart Filtering & AI Search:** Quickly sort by rent, location, lease type, and amenities.
- ✅ **Interactive Map:** View listings by proximity to campus and transit options.
